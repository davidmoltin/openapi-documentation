    calls for your applications.

- question: Can I record a meeting?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    Yes, you can record a meeting. See [Start recording a meeting](/guides/recording/start-recording).

- question: Where are the meeting recordings stored?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    The meeting recordings are saved in your cloud storage that you set up. The supported cloud providers are AWS S3 bucket, DigitalOcean Spaces, Azure Blob storage, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets. 

    For more information on how to configure storage configs for Elastic Path Recordings, see [Set storage configuration](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/recording/custom-cloud-storage#set-storage-configuration). 

    If you haven't set up your storage configurations, Elastic Path will keep your recordings for 7 days, after which they will expire and become inaccessible.

- question: Where is Elastic Path hosted?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Resiliency is important. Elastic Path uses multi-cloud and multi-region
    architecture to provide that seamless experience. Elastic Path is hosted in
    Mumbai, Virginia (US East), Singapore, and Frankfurt. You can also read
    through [this](https://dyte.io/blog/multi-region-resiliency/) blog to understand how Elastic Path manages a multi-region setup.

    can be called from services written in any language or framework. To
    find your language-specific backend code, refer to our [API reference](/api)

- question: What are webhooks?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Webhook service enables you to subscribe to server events. These events
    allow to trigger specific server actions in response to Elastic Path meeting
    events and state changes.

- question: How do I set up and transfer a recording to my storage configuration?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    You can pass an optional object storageConfig in the start recording
    request, and we will publish the recording directly to your cloud provider
    once it stops. For more information, see [Publishing a recording to your
    cloud provider](/guides/recording/custom-cloud-storage).

- question: I'm unable to locate my recorded meeting through the Developer Portal or downloadUrl. Was my meeting successfully recorded?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    There are two possible reasons:

    1. Elastic Path's recording feature will automatically stop recording if no participants are present in the meeting for 1 minute or longer. Please verify whether there were any participants present during the time the recording was initiated. 

    2. In case you haven't set up an external storage configuration and have also disabled uploads to Elastic Path's bucket, the recording will not be saved in any location and will be considered invalid. For more information, see [Publishing a recording to your
    cloud provider](/guides/recording/custom-cloud-storage).

- question: How do I create a region-specific room?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    To create a meeting in your preferred region, pass preferredRegion in
    the body of the createMeeting endpoint. For more information, see [Create a meeting](/api#/operations/createMeeting).

- question: Is it possible to record specific streams or users during a meeting, regardless of who is on the screen?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: No, it is not possible to selectively record specific streams or users. Instead, our recording feature captures the entire screen and not individual streams or users.

- question: Can I send an attachment via chat in a live session?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Yes, you can share media files via chat during a live session. You can
    send files, pdfs, images, and more. You can also use plugins such as Doc
    sync to view the shared file as a group and annotate the points that you
    would want to clarify.

- question: Can I retrieve the chat history of a session?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    You can programmatically retrieve all chat messages of a Elastic Path session using [Chat Replay API](/guides/export-chat-dump).
    For more information, see [How to Fetch Chat History of a Elastic Path Session](https://dyte.io/blog/fetch-chat-history-of-a-dyte-session/)
    blog.

- question: What is the duration for which Elastic Path keeps chat records?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Dyte stores chat records for a period of 7 days, only if you've enabled [Chat Replay API](/guides/export-chat-dump) for your organization. You can download the chat using the `chat_download_url` in CSV format from AWS S3.
    However, it is important to note that this download link is only valid for 24 hours. In case the link has expired, you can request for a new `chat_download_url` by sending an HTTP GET request to the [Chat Replay API](/guides/export-chat-dump).

- question: |-
    How do I view session metadata such as start time, end time, number of
    participants, and so on?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    You can use the [Session API](/api?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionDetails) to
    fetch the metadata for a given session.

- question: Is there a way for me to write on the screen during the meeting?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    Dyte provides multiple out-of-the-box plugins, for example, YouTube, Miro,
    WhiteBoard, and so on. You can use WhiteBoard for the collaboration.

- question: Can I add participants when creating a meeting only?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: No, after creating a meeting, use the [Add Participants
    API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to add participants to the
    meeting.

- question: |-
    Can I pass recording parameters such as codec and storage configurations
    when creating a meeting or create a template that can be used for all the
    meetings?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    Yes, codec and storage information can be passed through the recording API.
    Per recording, you can pass the parameters storageConfig and videoConfig.
    You can also send an email to [dev@dyte.io](mailto:dev.dyte.io) to set the
    orgs default configuration.

- question: |-
    Can I save my recordings directly to my storage bucket without saving them to Dyte?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    Yes, you can. By default, Dyte uploads all recordings to Dyte's S3 bucket in the AWS ap-south-1 region. However, Dyte provides users with the flexibility to choose whether or not to upload their recordings to Dyte's S3 bucket. 

    If you wish to disable uploads to Dyte's bucket, you can set the `dyte_bucket_config` parameter to false in the [Start Recording](/api?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) endpoint. For more information, see [Manage Dyte's Default Recording Upload Settings](/guides/recording/configure-dyte-bucket-config).

- question: |-
    What is the average file size of a Dyte recording?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']
  answer: |-
    Based on historical data, here are estimations for recording sizes with different components:

    - Format: H264 video codec
    - Resolution: 720p
    - Duration: 1 hour
    - Estimated size: On average, around 230MB
    - Range: Typically falls between 200-250MB, with potential outliers for static or rapidly changing content.

    Please note that these estimations are based on historical data and apply to recordings with a resolution of 720p. Actual sizes may vary depending on factors such as content, codec settings, and resolution.

- question: |-
    What if our server fails to consume the webhook? When will they be fired
    again, and are they idempotent?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    For timeouts and 5xx errors, we retry three times with a one-second delay
    between each retry.

- question: Is it possible to get the total running time of a session from the meeting.ended webhook?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    We send `startedAt` and `endedAt` timestamps in a `meeting.ended` webhook
    that can be used to compute the session's running time.

- question: What is the expected delay in the livestream, and what happens if it exceeds the expected delay?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Typically, there is a 3-5 second lag in all livestreams. If the delay exceeds 10 seconds, users can "Skip to Live," which involves dropping frames in order to synchronize the user's video with the live stream. Once the videos are synced, we stop dropping frames until the time exceeds 10 seconds again.

- question: What is the maximum number of hosts and viewers allowed to participate in a livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Dyte's Interactive Livestreaming (ILS) can currently accommodate 10,000 viewers and 100 hosts on a single livestream.

- question: What is the maximum number of users that the livestream can handle, and how does this impact its quality?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Currently, our platform can support up to 10,000 viewers in a single livestream, and the quality of the stream is not affected by the number of viewers. However, an increase in the number of users may impact other features such as chats and polls.

- question: How do I manage viewer permissions for a livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: You can manage the permissions for a viewer using presets. For livestreaming, you must create two presets. One preset is for the livestreaming host, while the other is for the livestreaming viewer. For details, see Create [Presets](/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).

- question: Can I join the livestream as a host in the middle of the livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Yes, you can. However, ensure that you've the required preset permissions. For details, see Create [Presets](/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).

- question: What permissions does a host require to start a livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants from the livestream. For details, see Create [Presets](/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).

- question: How much latency can be expected with Dyte's live streams?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Dyte provides live streams with a low latency of only 3 to 6 seconds.

- question: Is it necessary to generate new stream keys for each live event?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: |-
    No, stream keys can be reused multiple times. However, it's important to keep the stream key private as it grants access to the live stream. Therefore, users should be informed to keep their stream key secure.

    For more information, see [Live Stream Custom Video Input via RTMP](/guides/livestream/livestream-any-rtmp).

- question: |-
    I'm encountering audio and video problems while developing a live video
    solution for my app. I'm using Chrome to test the microphone and camera.
    What could be causing this?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    The issue could be due to the security features implemented by the
    browser. Most of the standard browsers with best security practices restrict
    many features to HTTPS instead of HTTP. You can read about the details of
    the features that are restricted in Chrome
    [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins).


    To troubleshoot, we recommend trying the steps mentioned in this
    [document](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/). If this does not
    resolve the issue, you can try using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as an
    alternative solution.


    To use ngrok, download the software and run it with the local port
    specified. This generates an HTTPS URL that you can use for testing the
    microphone and camera.

    1. Download ngrok.

    2. Run the command 'ngrok http PUT_LOCAL_PORT_HERE'.

    3. Use the HTTPS URL to test your microphone and camera.
