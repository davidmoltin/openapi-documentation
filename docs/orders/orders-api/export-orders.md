Use the `jobs` endpoint to export orders to a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. For the available filter types, see [filtering](/docs/orders/orders-api/orders-api-overview#filtering).

After a job is created, it returns a `pending` `status`. After a job is `complete`, you can access the file using the provided endpoint. For more information about the `jobs` endpoint, see [Jobs](/docs/orders/jobs-api/jobs-api-overview).
