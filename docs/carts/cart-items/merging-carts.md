title: Merging Carts

A shopper can have more than one cart and decide to merge the carts into one cart. If a shopper adds items to a cart anonymously and then signs into their account as a registered user, the system asks them which cart to use. For example, a shopper has an existing cart with items `A`, `B` and `C` in it. The shopper returns later and adds items `D` and `E` while not signed in. The shopper then signs in and wants to merge the new cart with the existing cart. After the carts merge, the cart contains items `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E`.

Any items that are duplicated from the anonymous cart to the registered cart are incremented by the quantity from the anonymous cart. For example, the shopper has an existing cart with items `A`, `B` and `C`, returns later and adds two more `A` items and one `B` item while not signed in. The shopper then signs in and wants to merge the new cart with the existing cart. The existing cart will contain three `A` items, two `B` items, and one `C` item.

## Errors

The cart linked to the shipping group ID cannot be merged with another cart because the shipping group is associated to a specific cart ID. If you attempt to merge one cart associated with the shipping group ID with another cart, only the cart items are merged and the following error response is returned:

```json
{
            "status": 404,
            "title": "Cart shipping group not found",
            "detail": "Shipping group not found for this cart.  Please verify the shipping group exists for this cart and is not already associated with an order.",
            "meta": {
                "cart_id": "2",
                "shipping_group_id": "4d475574-fb84-4d53-99c0-fda98e646a49"
            }
}
```
