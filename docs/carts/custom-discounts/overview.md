With custom discounts, you can allow your shoppers to apply discounts from external services to their purchases. To apply custom discounts to carts and cart items, you need to set `custom_discounts_enabled` field to `true` in your [Update Cart Settings](/docs/carts/cart-management/cart-settings#put-update-cart-settings).

You cannot add custom discounts to an empty cart.

:::caution
- You can apply up to five custom discounts to cart and cart item.
- The stores that use [simple calculation method](/docs/carts/calculate-totals#simple-calculation-method) do not support custom discounts.
