- Ensure that the user is signed into the store with appropriate seller permissions.

## Procedure

1. Get the authentication realm for accounts.

    For more information, see the [Get Account Authentication Settings](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/get-single-sign-on-customer-token) section.

1. To specify the login process for users, add a profile to the account realm.

    You can choose to set up a [Password Profile](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/password-profiles-api/overview) or an [OpenID Connect Profile](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/openid-connect-profiles-api/openid-connect-profiles-api-overview). However, you might have to modify other settings, such as redirect link settings, to use an OpenID Connect Profile. For more information, see the [Create an OpenID Connect Profile](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/openid-connect-profiles-api/create-an-oidc-profile) section.

1. Create one or more accounts.

    For more information, see the [Create an Account](/docs/accounts/using-account-management-api/create-an-account) section.

1. Register account members.

    Seller admin can register users to an the account realm by following the instructions in the [Creating a User Authentication Info](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/user-authentication-info-api/create-a-user-authentication-info) section. After creating the user authentication info, seller admin can associate the user to a login profile by following the instructions in one of the following sections:

    - [Create a User Authentication OpenID Connect Profile Info](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/user-authentication-openid-connect-profile-api/create-a-user-authentication-oidc-profile-info)
    - [Create a User Authentication Password Profile](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/user-authentication-password-profiles-api/create-a-user-authentication-password-profile)

    :::note
    After the registration, you can view the user as an account member through the account member APIs. For more information, see the [Account Members](/docs/accounts/using-account-members-api/overview) section.

1. Get the ID of the account member to add to the account using the [Get All Account Members](/docs/accounts/using-account-members-api/get-all-account-members) API endpoint.

1. Add the selected account member to the account membership.

    For more information, see the [Create an Account Membership](/docs/accounts/using-account-membership-api/create-an-account-membership) section.

After an account member is listed in an account membership, the user can shop on behalf of the account.
