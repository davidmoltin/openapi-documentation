Account Membership Settings allow Account Members to be associated to, at most, N accounts at a time. You can set this value to any number up to 10,000. The default value is 10,000.

This setting is only applied to new account memberships. If an account member is added to 3 accounts, and the setting is reduced to 1, the account member remains in the 3 accounts and can no longer be added to more.
