An `Account Member` resource is a user that you can add to accounts using [account memberships](/docs/accounts/using-account-membership-api/overview).

Account members API is read only, and you cannot add users using this API. You must use the [`user_authentication_info`](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/user-authentication-info-api/overview) object to create users in the [authentication realm](/docs/authentication/single-sign-on/authentication-realm-api/authentication-realm-api-overview) of [account authentication settings](/docs/authentication/account-authentication-settings). For more information on adding account members, see the [adding accounts and account members](/docs/accounts/add-account-and-member) section.
