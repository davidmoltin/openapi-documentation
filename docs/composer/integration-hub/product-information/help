    * **Enable Product Webhook**
    * Select this checkbox to create webhook events for any product in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud. The product information is shared with Yotpo as part of this integration. By default, the checkbox is selected and `catalog-release.updated` event is created.
    ---
    * **Enable Order Webhook**
    * Select this checkbox to create webhook events for orders in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud. The order details are shared with Yotpo as part of this integration. In the **Events** list, select the specific order event for which you want to create the webhook. For more information on order events, see [Observable Events](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/observable-events). By default, the checkbox is selected and the default event is `order.paid`.

       :::note
        In the **Events** list, we recommended that you select `order.fulfilled`. So, when a order is complete, a webhook event is generated in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud, and the order details are shared with Yotpo.

    * **Enable Customer Webhook**
    * Select this checkbox if you want to create webhook events for customer information in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud. The customer details are shared with Yotpo as
    part of this integration. Click [Add Customer Events](/assets/add-customer-events-yotpo.png) to add the events for which you want to create webhooks in Elastic Path
    Commerce Cloud; by default, `customer.selected` and `customer.updated` are added. You can remove these default events too and add specific customer events as per your
    requirements. For example, select `customer.deleted` if you want to disable customer status in Yotpo when a customer account is deleted in Elastic Path Commerce Cloud.

* **Product Rating Extension**
    * The number of reviews and average ratings received for a product is saved in Commerce Manager. You must define a template to save the customer feedback. The templates follow a JSON structure, where you can mention the following information. You can use a predefined template (**Configurations** > **Templates**) or use the default one.

      {% list type="checkmark" %}
        * `Name` - the name of the template.
        * `Description` - the template description.
        * `slug` - the slug to identify the template
        * `Enabled` - `true` if the template is enabled, `false` if not.
          {% /list %}

      Here is an example of the default template:

         ```
         {
         "name": "Ratings and Reviews",
         "description": "Ratings and Reviews",
         "slug": "products(ratings)",
         "enabled": true
         }
        ```

      The Elastic Path Commerce Cloud and Yotpo integration creates the following attributes in the product templates:

        - `review_count`
        - `average_rating`

      View the review count and average ratings received for a product in Commerce Manager.

      {% list type="checkmark" %}

        2. Click a specific product.
        3. Select **Product Templates** > **Ratings and Reviews**.
      {% /list %}




11. Click **Next**.

       -  [JSONata](http://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html) is the query language used for the product template. JSONata provides JSON Path style queries and adds support for more advanced queries and even transformations.

    * **Customer Template**
    * This template is used to create and/or update customer information in Yotpo. You can add any of the supported customer attributes in the template. For example, you can include a customer contact number so when customer information is sent to Yotpo, it contains the contact number. Here is a snapshot of the default customer template.

       ```json
       {
         "customer": {
           "external_id": payload.data.id,
           "email": payload.data.email,

           "account_created_at": payload.data.meta.timestamps.created_at
           }
        }
      ```
    {% /table %}
