The Addresses API allows you to organize customer and account addresses. Addresses are a sub-resource of a [`customer`](/docs/customer-management/customer-managment-api/customer-management-api-overview) and [`account`](/docs/accounts/using-account-management-api/account-management-api-overview) resources. A `customer` or `account` can have multiple addresses, such as `home`, `work`, and `neighbour`.

You can use a customer address with an [implicit](/docs/authentication/Tokens/implicit-token#post-create-an-implicit-token) Bearer token, which is recommended for client-side interactions. You can also use [client_credentials](/docs/authentication/Tokens/client-credential-token#post-create-a-client-credential-token) Bearer token, which is recommended for back-end interactions.

You can use an account address with either [client_credentials](/docs/authentication/Tokens/client-credential-token#post-create-a-client-credential-token) Bearer token or a combination of [implicit](/docs/authentication/Tokens/implicit-token#post-create-an-implicit-token) Bearer token and [Account Management authentication](/docs/authentication/Tokens/account-management-authentication-token) token.
