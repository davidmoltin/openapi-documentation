To create your organization products, you can:

- create your products directly in your organization. 
- import your products from your other company systems.

{% expandable-info title="Important" %}
You must ensure that products in organizations and stores have unique SKUs. If a store product is created with a SKU that is already in use by an organization product, an error message is displayed. This helps maintain accurate inventory management and avoid potential conflicts between organization and store products.

AllGoods have selected Commerce to support their multi-store needs. AllGoods decide to import products from their other company systems into their organization.

Once the products are available in Commerce, going forward, AllGoods can create all new products directly in Commerce.
