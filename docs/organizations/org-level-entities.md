Entities have different characteristics, depending on whether they are at organization or store level.

{% expandable-info title="Important" %}
In multi-store management scenarios, it is important to ensure that products in both organizations and stores have unique SKUs. If a store product is created with a SKU that is already in use by an organization product, an error message is displayed. This helps maintain accurate inventory management and avoid potential conflicts between organization and store products.
