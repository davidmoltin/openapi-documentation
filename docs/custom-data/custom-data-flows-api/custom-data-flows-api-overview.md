## Core and Non-core Flows

The following table describes the differences between core and non-core flows:

| Core Flows                                                    | Non-core Flows |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|
| Extend an existing resource.                                  | Create a new resource. |
| Entries managed automatically by Commerce. | Create and manage entries manually. |
| Requests are sent to the `fields` endpoint.                   | Requests are sent to the `entries` endpoint. |

:::note
You cannot delete core flows after creating them on API or Commerce Manager.

## Add a new resource

Adding a new resource is applicable only to non-core (custom) flows.

## Resource structure

A [flow](/docs/custom-dataows-api/Flows) describes a collection of fields. It is named after the internal entity type you want to associate it with. For example, a flow with a slug of `products` applies to all product responses in your store.

A [field](/docs/custom-dataows-api/fields) represents a single field of data, such as `Product Rating`, that is applied to an entity. All fields have a type , such as `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `date` or `relationship`, a default value, and an optional set of validation rules.

An [entry](/docs/custom-dataows-api/entries) is a specific instance of a flow, and is associated with a specific instance of an entity. For example, a single product. Use entries for custom flows (non-core) only.
