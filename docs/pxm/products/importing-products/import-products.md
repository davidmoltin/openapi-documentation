You can use the Product Import API to:

- Add new products, including:

    - main image files. See [Importing Main Image Files](/docs/pxm/products/importing-products/overview#importing-main-image-files).
    - custom data. See [Importing custom data](/docs/pxm/products/importing-products/overview#importing-custom-data-flows).

- Make bulk updates to existing products. 

You cannot use product import to:

- Delete existing products.
- Import product bundles.

The Product Import API uses a [Comma Separated Values (CSV)](/docs/pxm/products/importing-products/product-importer-csv) file to import products, main image files and custom extension data. Each row in a `.csv` file represents a product you want to create/update.  

Each file can have 50,000 rows, including the header. If a CSV file exceeds 50,000 rows, an error is displayed, and the products are not imported. A `.csv` file must not be larger than 50 megabytes. If a `.csv` file is larger than 50 megabytes, a `503 client read error` is displayed. 

If you want to create/update more than 50,000 products or your `.csv` file is larger than 50 megabytes, you must have a separate `.csv` file and import each `.csv` file one at a time.
