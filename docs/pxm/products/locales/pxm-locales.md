Product Experience Manager supports localization of products and hierarchies. If your store supports multiple languages, you can localize product names and descriptions. Commerce supports all languages in [Unicode 14.0 Character Code Charts](http://www.unicode.org/charts/index.html). You add and edit localized product names and descriptions using:

## Commerce Manager

You can localize product names and descriptions when [creating products](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/create-products). By default, there are a number of language codes available. You activate locales in Commerce Manager in **SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Locales**. You can activate a maximum of 5 languages.

## Create a Product API Request

You can use [create a product](/docs/pxm/products/ep-pxm-products-api/create-a-product) API request to add your own custom language codes. You might want to do this if the language that you want to use is not available by default in Commerce Manager.
