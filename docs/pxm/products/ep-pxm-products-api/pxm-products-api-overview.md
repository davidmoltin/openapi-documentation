## The `build_rules` Object

You can build a combination of child products associated with a product, based on build rules that you specify. This is useful, for example, if you have a variation option that you do not sell. This makes managing and building your child products quick and easy.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `default` | `string` | Specifies the default behavior, either `include` or `exclude`. |
| `include` | `array` | An array of option IDs to include when child products are built. Each combination consists of a nested array of option IDs from one or more variations. Combinations of option IDs in the nested arrays must come from different variations. |
| `exclude` | `array` | An array of option IDs to exclude when child products are built. Each combination consists of a nested array of option IDs from one or more variations. Combinations of option IDs in the nested arrays must come from different variations. |

See [Build Child Products Using Variations](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/build-pxm-variations).
