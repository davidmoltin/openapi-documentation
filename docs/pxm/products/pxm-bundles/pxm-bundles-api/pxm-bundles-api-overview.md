The Bundles API is for Administrator use only. Do not use these endpoints on your customer-facing frontends.

With the Product Experience Manager services, you can create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product, comprising two or more products that you want to sell together. For example, a consumer electronics and video game company, *Playtend Games* can sell a *Playtend* video game console as a bundle that includes the console, controller, and game. The price of the bundle might be different from the total of the individual products. A bundle must contain at least two items, either the same items or different items.

| `id` | `string` | A unique ID that is generated when you create the bundle. |
| `type` | `string` | The type of resource object. You must use `product`. |
| `attributes` | [`object`](#the-attributes-object) | The attributes that describe the bundle. |

## The `attributes` Object

The bundle attributes that can be displayed in your storefront.

| Name | Type | Description |

{% expandable-info title="Important" %}

- Custom names and values prefixed with `$` are not supported.
- You cannot have more than 1500 options in a bundle. 

{% /expandable-info %}

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :---| :--- |
| `component: <key>` | `string` | The name of the component, such as `games`. The `bundle_configuration` uses the component key to reference a component. A component key should be relatively short and must not contain any special characters. See [create a bundle](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles-api/create-a-bundle). |
| `component: <key>: min` | `integer` | The minimum number of product options a shopper can select from this component. |
| `component: <key>: max` | `integer` | The maximum number of product options a shopper can select from this component. |
| `component: <key>: sort_order` | `integer` | The sort order of the components. The `create a bundle` and `update a bundle` endpoints do not sort the components. You can use the `sort_order` attribute when programming your storefront to display the components in the order that you want. |
|`component: <key>: name` | `string` | The component name. The component name is the name that is displayed in your storefront. See [create a bundle](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles-api/create-a-bundle). |
| `component: <key>: options` | `array` | The product options included in a component. This can be the ID of another bundle. See [Bundles of Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/bundles-of-bundles). |
