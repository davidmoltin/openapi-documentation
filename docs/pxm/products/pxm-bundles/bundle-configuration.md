With Product Experience Manager, you can create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product comprising two or more products that you want to sell together. For example, a consumer electronics and video game company, *Playtend Games* can sell a *Playtend* video game console as a bundle that includes the console, controller, and game. The price of the bundle might be different from the total of the individual products. A bundle must contain at least two products, either the same items or different items. You must not assign a product to a bundle, if the product is in draft status as this invalidates the bundle.

You can have:

- Dynamic bundles: Dynamic bundles allow your shoppers to choose their own options in a bundle. See [Dynamic Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/dynamic-bundles).
- Bundles of bundles: Your bundle consists of child bundles. See [Bundles of Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/bundles-of-bundles).

## Bundle Components and Options

You can create multiple components within a bundle. Each component must have at least one or more options. Each option is a product and a quantity. 

:::caution
You cannot have more than 1500 options in a bundle. 
:::

For example, *Playtend Games* can create a bundle where the total bundle price is calculated based on the options that the buyers choose. Shoppers can select a base console option, two games options, and a controller option as in the following example:

1. Select one of the following options in the gaming console component:

    - Gaming Console 512 MB Storage. Regular price is $500, selling for $475.
    - Gaming Console 1 GB Storage. Regular price is $750, selling for $725.

1. Select one of the following options in the game component:

    - Option 1:

        - Playtend Roboselect Game, selling for $50
        - Playtend Burndown Game, selling for $45
        - Playtend Invaders Game, selling for $50

    - Option2:

        - Playtend Doomsday Game, selling for $35
        - Playtend Happyday Game, selling for $35
        - Playtend Birthday Game, selling for $40

1. Select one of the following options in the controllers component:

    - Red Controller, selling for $40
    - Blue Controller, selling for $40
    - Green Controller, selling for $40
    - Invaders Controller, selling for $75

If the shopper chooses the following options for their bundle, the total is $885:

- Gaming Console 1 GB Storage ($725)
- Playtend Burndown Game ($45)
- Playtend Birthday Game ($40)
- Invaders Controller ($75)

You can specify a sort value for your components and options. The sort value is visible when you add the products to your catalogs. You can then use the sort value to program your storefront to display the bundle components and component options in the order that you want.

:::caution
Commerce Manager does not sort components and component options. You must program your storefront to sort the components and component options in the order that you want.

## Bundle Pricing

Bundles can have:

- Fixed pricing - enables you to assign a fixed price for all products in a bundle. 
- Automatic/cumulative pricing - the price of a bundle is generated automatically based on the sum of the component products.

For more information, see [Bundle Pricing](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/bundle-pricing) 

## Adding Products From Bundles of Bundles to Carts

When using bundles of bundles, only products from child bundles should be added to a cart. This is because if you add a parent bundle to a cart and call the cart, the cart returns information about the parent bundle and the name of the chld bundle, but no child bundle components are returned.

When designing your storefront, you must only allow child bundles to be added to carts. 

## Before you Begin

- Ensure that you have created at least one price book.
- Ensure that all products that you want to add in the bundle are created with the required details.
- Ensure any child bundles that you want to add to a parent bundle are created with the required details.

{% expandable-info title="Important" %}
 A bundle without a SKU must have a minimum quantity of components and options. Either:

 - a single option with a minimum quantity of 2.
 - 2 options each with a minimum quantity of 1.

### Managing product inventory

You cannot track the inventory of a bundle without SKU. However, you can track the inventory based on the availability of individual items.

    - **Product Name**
    - **SKU**
    - **In stock**
    - **Allocated**: The amount of reserved product in stock.

## Editing Bundles

After editing a bundle, ensure that you republish all catalogs that contain the bundle to reflect the changes.

1. In the **Product Experience Manager > Products** page, do one of the following:

    - Double click a product.
    - Click the **...** icon and click **Edit**.

1. Update the details as required.
    For the changes to appear in the store, republish the catalogs that contain hierarchies with this product.

## Deleting Bundles

Deleting a bundle removes bundle information and the associated media files from the database. However, the product options in the bundle are not deleted from the database. You must republish the catalog to update the catalog release with the changes. If you want to keep your hierarchies and price books up to date, remove the deleted bundles from those resources.

Even after deleting a bundle, an order history that has the bundle still keeps the product information of the deleted bundle, such as, the product SKU, product ID, and price. However, clicking the product does not take a shopper to product details.

- In the **Product Experience Manager > Products** page, click the **...** icon and click **Delete**.

:::tip
You can remove bundle products from a catalog, but still keep them in the database for audit purposes.

1. Set the product status to **Draft**.
1. Remove the product from hierarchies and republish the affected catalog so that it does not appear in the storefront.
