With Product Experience Manager, you can create and manage bundles. A bundle is a purchasable product, comprising of two or more products that you want to sell together. For example, a consumer electronics and video game company, *Playtend Games* can sell a *Playtend* video game console as a bundle that includes the console, controller, and game. The price of the bundle might be different from the total of the individual products. A bundle must contain at least two items, either the same items or different items. 

You must not assign a product to a bundle if the product is in draft status as this invalidates the bundle.

You can have:

- Dynamic bundles. Dynamic bundles allow your shoppers to choose their own options in a bundle. See [Dynamic Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/dynamic-bundles).
- Bundles of bundles. Your bundle consists of child bundles. See [Bundles of Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/bundles-of-bundles).

## Bundle Components and Options

You can create multiple components within a bundle. Each component must have at least one or more options. Each option is a product and a quantity. 

:::caution
You cannot have more than 1500 options in a bundle.

For example, *Playtend Games* can create a bundle where the total bundle price is calculated based on the options that the buyers choose. Shoppers can select a base console option, two games options, and a controller option as in the following example:

    - Gaming Console 512 MB Storage. Regular price is $500, selling for $475.
