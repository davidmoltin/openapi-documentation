Products contain details, such as, the name, description, and SKU. Products are listed in a catalog using hierarchies. These catalogs then display the product in the storefront, such as a website. In Elastic Path Commerce Manager, you can also associate attributes with products using templates. However, product information does not contain pricing details. Pricing details for the products are managed in price books. See 
[Pricebooks](/docs/pxm/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks).

## Products and Catalog Releases

For a product to appear in the store, the product must be in the active state. By default, a product is created in the draft state. This is to ensure that the product details are reviewed and approved before publishing it. When you publish a catalog, only the active products appear in the catalog release. If you change the product status and want it to reflect in the catalog release, you must republish the catalog release. 

In addition, a product must belong to at least one hierarchy. When you publish a catalog, the active products in the hierarchies appear in a catalog release. A catalog can have one or more hierarchies of products. The hierarchies contain all the products that you want to display in your store. Only the products that are associated with nodes in the selected hierarchies are included in the catalog. You can create your hierarchies and nodes when configuring your products.
