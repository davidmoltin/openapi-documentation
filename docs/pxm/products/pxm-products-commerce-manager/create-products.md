# Prerequisite

- Ensure that you have [created at least one price book](/docs/pxm/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#creating-price-books).

## Best practises

- [Create at least one template with attributes](/docs/pxm/products/extending-pxm-products/templates) before creating a product.
- [Create at least one variation with options and required modifiers to build child products](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/variations) before creating a product.

The following steps provide a high-level procedure to complete a product configuration:

1. In the **Product Experience Manager > Products** page, click **Create New**.
1. In the [**Product Details**](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/add-product-details) tab, enter the product details.
1. In the **Product Templates** tab, add [templates](/docs/pxm/products/extending-pxm-products/templates) for the product.
1. In the **Pricing** tab, configure the [pricing settings](/docs/pxm/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#creating-price-books) for the product.
1. In the **Variations** tab, associate [variations](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/variations) with the product and [build child products](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/assign-variations-build-child-products) with the variations and options.
1. In the **Inventory** tab, manage the product inventory.
1. In the **Media Management** tab, upload the product images.

You can use **Back** and **Next** buttons to navigate through the tabs and the **Save & Exit** button to save the changes and exit the window any time.
