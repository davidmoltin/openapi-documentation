:::caution
This endpoint is for Administrator use only. Do not use this endpoint on your customer-facing frontends.
:::

The `jobs` endpoint displays the status of a number of endpoints that function as jobs, for example, product [import](/docs/pxm/products/importing-products/product-import-pxm) and [export](/docs/pxm/products/exporting-products/export-products), and [duplicating hierarchies](/docs/pxm/hierarchies/hierarchies-api/duplicate-a-hierarchy).

If, when viewing the status of the [Build Child Products](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/child-products-api/build-child-products) endpoint, the job endpoint displays the following error:

**slug must be URL compatible.**  

This means the variation option name contains special characters, period, or spaces. While building child products, the option name is utilized as part of the product [SLUG](/docs/pxm/products/ep-pxm-products-api/pxm-products-api-overview#the-attributes-object). This error occurs when a variation option name is not URL safe.

See [Create Child Products Using Variations and Modifiers](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-product-variations/generate-pxm-variations).
