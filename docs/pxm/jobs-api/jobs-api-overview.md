The `jobs` endpoint displays the status of a number of endpoints that function as jobs, for example, product [import](/docs/pxm/products/importing-products/product-import-pxm) and [export](/docs/pxm/products/exporting-products/export-products), and [duplicating hierarchies](/docs/pxm/hierarchies/hierarchies-api/duplicate-a-hierarchy).
