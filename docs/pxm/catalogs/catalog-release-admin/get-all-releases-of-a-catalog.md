## `GET` Get all Releases of a Published Catalog

```http
https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/pcm/catalogs/:catalogId/releases
```

Returns a list of all published releases of the specified catalog. Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two releases prior to the current release. You can see the differences between the last 2 consecutive catalog releases using the `delta` link returned in the response of a [publish a catalog](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-release-admin/publish-a-catalog) endpoint.

You can use the `is_full_delta`attribute returned from the `get a release of a catalog` endpoint to determine if you need to refresh the data in your company system before publishing a catalog release and injecting fresh data in a `delta` link. The `is_full_delta` attribute tells you if this is a full publish of a catalog release. Using a search service as an example, if the `is_full_delta` attribute is `true`, you should remove all data about that catalog from the search service before publishing a catalog release and injecting fresh data from the `delta` file. See [publish a catalog](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-release-admin/publish-a-catalog).

If the `is_full_publish` attribute returned in the response is `false`, data from the previous catalog release overlaid the existing data in the `delta` file. The `is_full_publish` attribute is always `true` the first time a catalog is published.
