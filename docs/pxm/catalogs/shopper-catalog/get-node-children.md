## `GET` Get a Node始s Children

```http
https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/catalog/nodes/:nodeId/relationships/children
```

Returns the child nodes for a node in the catalog.

If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches the shopper始s context is used to determine which catalog is retrieved. For information about how rules are matched, see [Resolving Catalog Rules](/docs/pxm/catalogs/shopper-catalog/catalog-shopper-overview#resolving-catalog-rules).

You can see which parent nodes a node is associated with in the `bread_crumb` metadata for each node. This is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. For more information, see [Catalog Releases Overview](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/overview).

The response lists the products associated with the nodes. If products are [curated](/docs/pxm/products/curating-products), they are displayed in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each of your hierarchies, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. 

- If you don't provide any `curated_products`, products are listed by their `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated product first.
- If you configure `curated_products` for only a few products, the curated products are displayed first and the other products are displayed in the order of `updated_at` time.
- You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20 curated products.
- A product that is curated has the `"curated_product": true` attribute displayed.
- If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also removed from the `curated_products` list.

### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront

In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.

`filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`

- Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.
- You can have as many node Ids as you want.
- It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are returned in the order they were last updated.
