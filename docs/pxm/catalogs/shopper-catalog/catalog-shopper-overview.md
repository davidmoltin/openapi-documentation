Use the Catalog View API to create, manage, and publish catalogs for an organization or a store. When you publish a catalog for a store, you can define catalog rules so that you can show catalogs with different pricing or different products to preferred customers or channels. These endpoints can be used in your customer-facing frontends.

A catalog is a combination of one or more hierarchies and a price book. Use the Products API and Hierarchies API to create a hierarchy of products that can be included in a catalog. Use the Price Book API to associate prices with products.

## Catalog Caching 

When conducting a `GET` on `catalog` endpoints, all data returned, including catalog releases, products, nodes and hierarchies, are cached for 5 minutes. This means, if you call the same endpoint again, the catalog data is retrieved from the cached objects pool, optimizing the performance and efficiency of your store front.

If you use any of the `catalog` endpoints with a `filter` or `include` query parameter, these are cached separately. 

The cached entries disappear from the cached objects pool after 5 minutes.

## The Catalog object

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| `attributes.published_at` | `string($date-time)` | If published, the date and time the catalog was published. |
| `links` | [`object`](#the-links-object) | A URL to the catalog. |

## The `Release` Object

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | A unique identifier for the node. |
| `type` | `string` | The type of object being returned. Always: `catalog-release`. |
| `attributes.hierarchy_ids` | `[array]` | An array of references to the hierarchies in the release. |
| `catalog_id` | `string` | A unique identifier for the catalog. |
| `attributes.description` | `string` | A description of the node, such as the name of a category. |
| `attributes.name` | `string` | The name of the release. |
| `attributes.curated_products` | `[array]` | An array of product IDs whose products are curated. See [Curated Products](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products#curated-products). |

| `meta` | (#the-meta-object) | The `meta` data includes: `is_full_delta` (see [publish a catalog](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-release-admin/publish-a-catalog)), `created_at`, `release_status` and `started_at` attributes. |
| `relationships` | `object` | The `relationships` data for the catalog.  |

## The `components` Object

{% expandable-info title="Important" %}

- Custom names and values prefixed with `$` are not supported.
- You cannot have more than 1500 options in a bundle. 

{% /expandable-info %}

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :---| :--- |
| `component: <key>` | `string` | The name of the component, such as `games`. The `bundle_configuration` uses the component key to reference a component. A component key should be relatively short and must not contain any special characters. See [create a bundle](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles-api/create-a-bundle). |
| `component: <key>: min` | `integer` | The minimum number of product options a shopper can select from this component. |
| `component: <key>: max` | `integer` | The maximum number of product options a shopper can select from this component. |
| `component: <key>: sort_order` | `integer` | The sort order of the components. The `create a bundle` and `update a bundle` endpoints do not sort the components. You can use the `sort_order` attribute when programming your storefront to display the components in the order that you want. |
|`component: <key>: name` | `string` | The component name. The component name is the name that is displayed in your storefront. See [create a bundle](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/pxm-bundles-api/create-a-bundle). |
| `component: <key>: options` | `array` | The product options included in a component. This can be the ID of another bundle. See [Bundles of Bundles](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-bundles/bundles-of-bundles). |

### The `Links` object

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `self` | `string` | Refers to the object that calls this object. |

## The Rule object

If you have multiple catalogs, add catalog rules. A catalog rule defines the circumstances under which you want to display a catalog to a customer. For example, the catalog rule could be preferred customers or mobile apps or both. If you create catalog rules, be sure to create a base catalog rule to use when no other catalog rule fits the shopper request. A base catalog rule is defined with a `type`, `name`, and `catalog_id` only.

:::note
If you have one catalog for all customers and channels, you can omit creating this object.
:::

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `type` | `string` | The type of object being returned. Always: `catalog_rule` |
| `attributes.name` | `string` | The name of the rule without spaces. |
| `attributes.description` | `string` | The purpose for this rule. |
| `attributes.catalog_id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the catalog to display in this rule. **V2** If you want to display a catalog that contains v2 Products, Brands, Categories, and Collections, specify `legacy`. |
| `attributes.customer_ids` | `[array]` | The list of customers who are eligible to see this catalog. If empty, the rule matches all customers. |
| `attributes.account_ids` | `[array]` | The list of accounts who are eligible to see this catalog. If empty, the rule matches all accounts. |
| `attributes.channels` | `[array]` | The list of channels in which this catalog can be displayed. A channel is the shopping experience, such as a mobile app or web storefront. If empty, the catalog rule matches all channels. The channel will eventually be included in the bearer token that is used for authorization, but currently, you must set the `EP-Channel` header in your requests. |
| `attributes.tags` | `[array]` |  A list of user-defined tags that can be used to further restrict the eligibility criteria for this rule. Requests populate the catalog rule tag using the `EP-Context-Tag` header. |

### Resolving catalog rules

When there is a request for a catalog, the store displays the catalog with the rule that matches the most attributes of the shopper始s context.

The request triggers the following steps:

1. Compares the shopper始s context against the defined catalog rules.
1. Determines the best match.
1. Retrieves the catalog associated with the matching catalog rule.

The follow examples show how the best match might be resolved:

- A shopper matches one of the `customer_ids` in one catalog rule only. The catalog for that catalog rule is displayed.
- A shopper matches one of the `customer_ids` in one catalog rule only, but doesn始t match any of the `tags` specified in that catalog rule. Because there are no other catalog rules for this `customer_id`, the catalog for the catalog rule is displayed because it is the best match.
- A shopper is browsing a store using the store始s mobile app, which matches `channel=mobile` in two catalog rules. The catalog displayed depends on matches with the `tags` or `customer_ids` attributes. If there is no other matching attribute, the first catalog rule found by the store is used. The best practice is to create catalog rules that cover all cases so that you avoid this situation.
- An unknown shopper is browsing the only channel offered by the seller. The store displays the base catalog.
