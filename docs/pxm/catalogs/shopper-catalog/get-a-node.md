## `GET` Get a Node

```http
https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/catalog/nodes/:nodeId
```

Returns a node from the catalog.

If you have multiple catalog rules defined, the rule that best matches the shopper ºs context is used to determine which catalog to retrieve. For information about how catalog rules are matched, see [Resolving Catalog Rules](/docs/pxm/catalogs/shopper-catalog/catalog-shopper-overview#resolving-catalog-rules).

You can see the parent nodes a node is associated with in the `bread_crumb` metadata for each node. This is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. For more information, see [Catalog Releases Overview](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/overview).

The response lists the products associated with a node. If products are [curated](/docs/pxm/products/curating-products), they are displayed in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each of your nodes, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. 

- If you don't provide any `curated_products`, products are listed by their `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated product first.
- If you configure `curated_products` for only a few products, the curated products are displayed first and the other products are displayed in the order of `updated_at` time.
- You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20 curated products.
- A product that is curated has the `"curated_product": true` attribute displayed.
- If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also removed from the `curated_products` list.
