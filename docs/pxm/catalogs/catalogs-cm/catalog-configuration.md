A catalog can have one or more hierarchies of products. The hierarchies contain all the products that you want to display in your organization or store. For products to be included in a catalog, the products must:
[
- have a `live` status.
- be associated with nodes in the selected hierarchies. You can filter your products using the **Has Node Assignment** attributes to check that the products will be included in your catalog. See [Filtering Products](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products-commerce-manager/filter-products).

A catalog must have at least one price book associated with it. 

You can create multiple price books for different scenarios, such as seasonal sales, business versus retail customer pricing, and reward programs. You can configure your catalog to have up to 5 price books. If you have multiple price books, you must specify a priority for your price books. Product prices are displayed in the catalog according to the priority of the price books. Priority is a number and the price book with the highest number has the highest priority. 

When you publish a catalog, the products in the hierarchies appear in a catalog release. A catalog release provides a snapshot of product information taken at the time of publication.

If you make any changes to the hierarchies, the products in a hierarchy, or price books, you must republish your catalogs. The changes do not appear in the storefront unless a catalog is re-published.

You can have many catalogs available in a store. You can use catalog rules to specify when to display your catalogs. See [Configure Shopper Catalog Rules](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalogs-cm/catalog-rules).
