## `GET` Get a Catalog Release by Release ID

```http
https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/pcm/catalogs/:catalogId/releases/releaseId/
```

Retrieves a published catalog. Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two releases prior to the current release. You can see the differences between the last 2 consecutive catalog releases using the `delta` link returned in the response of a [publish a catalog](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-release-admin/publish-a-catalog) endpoint.

You can use the `is_full_delta` attribute returned from the `get a release of a catalog` endpoint to determine if you need to refresh the data in your company system before injecting fresh data in a `delta` link. The `is_full_delta` attribute tells you if this is a full publish of the catalog. Using a search service as an example, if the `is_full_delta` attribute is `true`, you should remove all data about that catalog from the search service before injecting fresh data from the `delta` file. If the `is_full_delta` attribute is `false`, then data from the previous catalog overlays the existing data in the `delta` file. The `is_full_delta` attribute is always `true` the first time a catalog is published.
