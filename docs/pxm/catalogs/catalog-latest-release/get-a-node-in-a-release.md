## `GET` Get a Node from a Catalog Release

```http
https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/pcm/catalogs/:catalogId/releases/latest/nodes/:nodeId
```

Returns a node from a published catalog.

:::note
Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two releases prior to the current release.
:::

:::caution
Use `releaseId` to delete a specific release than the latest catalog.
:::

You can see the parent nodes a node is associated with in the `bread_crumb` metadata for each node. This is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. For more information, see [Product Experience Manager Catalogs API](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/overview).

The response lists the products associated with a node. If products are [curated](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products#curated-products), they are displayed in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each of your nodes, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. 

- If you don't provide any `curated_products`, products are listed by their `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated product first.
- If you configure `curated_products` for only a few products, the curated products are displayed first and the other products are displayed in the order of `updated_at` time.
- You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20 curated products.
- If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also removed from the `curated_products` list. 
- A product that is curated has the `"curated_product": true` attribute displayed.
