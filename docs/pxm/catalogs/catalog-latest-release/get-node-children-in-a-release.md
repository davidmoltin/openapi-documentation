## `GET` Get a Nodeʼs Children from a Catalog Release

```http
https://useast.api.elasticpath.com/pcm/catalogs/:catalogId/releases/latest/nodes/:nodeId/relationships/children
```

Returns the child nodes for a node from a published catalog.

:::note
Currently, published catalogs are limited to the current release and two releases prior to the current release.
:::

:::caution
Use `releaseId` to delete a specific release than the latest catalog.
:::

You can see the parent nodes a node is associated with in the `bread_crumb` metadata for each node. This is useful if you want to improve how your shoppers search your store, for example. For more information, see [Catalogs API](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-latest-release/overview).

The response lists the products associated with the nodes. If products are [curated](/docs/pxm/products/pxm-products#curated-products), they are displayed in `curated_products`. Product curation allows you to promote specific products within each of your hierarchies, enabling you to create unique product collections in your storefront. 

- If you don't provide any `curated_products`, products are listed by their `updated_at` time in descending order, with the most recently updated product first.
- If you configure `curated_products` for only a few products, the curated products are displayed first and the other products are displayed in the order of `updated_at` time.
- You can only curate 20 products or less. You cannot have more than 20 curated products.
- A product that is curated has the `"curated_product": true` attribute displayed.
- If a curated product is removed from a node, the product is also removed from the `curated_products` list.

### Building breadcrumbs in a storefront

In a catalog, you can use a filter to return a list of nodes in a hierarchy structure that a product belongs to. You can use this to build breadcrumbs in your storefront. An example is shown below.

`filter=in(id,c83bfe55-0d87-4302-a86d-ab19e7e323f1,6003d7ef-84f3-49bb-a8bd-4cbfa203dcbb)`

- Specify the node Ids in the filter expression.
- You can have as many node Ids as you want.
- It does not matter what order you specify the node Ids. The nodes are returned in the order they were last updated.
