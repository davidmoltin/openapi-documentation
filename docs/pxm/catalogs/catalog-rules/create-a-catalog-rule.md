If you have multiple catalogs, create catalog rule resources. With catalog rules, you can display different catalogs to different shoppers. For example, you can display a preferred pricing catalog to a few special customers. Or you can display one catalog to shoppers using your website and a different catalog to shoppers using your mobile app. Finally, you can define custom criteria by creating tags.

:::note

- If you have one catalog for all customers and channels, you can omit creating this resource.
- Due to the way catalogs are cached in Commerce, using catalog rules to display catalogs sometimes causes a 5-minute time delay before the catalogs are displayed.
- You cannot create catalog rules for organization catalogs.

:::

For ideas about the kinds of business scenarios you can achieve with catalog rules, see [Catalog Rules](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-rules/catalog-rules). To understand how catalogs are matched to shoppers by using rules, see [Resolving Catalog Rules](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-configuration/catalog-configuration-overview#resolving-catalog-rules).

## Parameters

### Headers

| Name            | Required | Type     | Description                          |
|:----------------|:---------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|
| `Authorization` | Required | `string` | The Bearer token required to get access to the API. Note that this must be a client credentials token. |

### Body

Required. A [Rule](/docs/pxm/catalogs/catalog-configuration/catalog-configuration-overview#the-rule-object) object with the following attributes.

A rule object with only the required attributes defined applies to all customers and all channels. If no other catalog rules apply, the store displays this base catalog.

| Attribute                 | Required | Type      | Description               |
|:--------------------------|:---------|:----------|:--------------------------|
| `type`                    | Required | `string`  | Specifies the type of the resource. Set this value to `catalog_rule`. |
| `attributes.name`         | Required | `string`  | Specifies the name of the rule without spaces. |
| `attributes.description`  | Optional | `string`  | Specifies the purpose of this rule. |
| `attributes.catalog_id`   | Required | `string`  | Specifies the unique identifier of the catalog for this rule. **V2**  If you want to display a catalog that contains v2 Products, Brands, Categories, and Collections, specify `legacy`. |
| `attributes.account_ids`  | Optional | `[array]` | Specifies the list of accounts who are eligible to see this catalog. If this field is empty, the rule matches all accounts. |
| `attributes.customer_ids` | Optional | `[array]` | Specifies the list of customers who are eligible to see this catalog. If this field is empty, the rule matches all customers. |
| `attributes.channels`     | Optional | `[array]` | Specifies the list of channels in which this catalog can be displayed. A channel is the shopping experience, such as a mobile app or web storefront. If empty, the rule matches all channels. |
| `attributes.tags`         | Optional | `[array]` | Specifies a list of user-defined tags that can be used to further restrict the eligibility criteria for this rule. Requests populate the rule tag using the `EP-Context-Tag` header. |
| `attributes.schedules`    | Optional | `[array]` | Specifies a time period when a catalog is displayed, such as on a specific date or during summer. The `schedules` attribute must include `valid_from` and `valid_to`. `valid_from` matches the date and time that the catalog is displayed from. `valid_to` matches the date and time the catalog is displayed to. Commerce runs on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time and conforms to [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339). You can offset the timezone by adding the offset to the end of the date and time. For example, a catalog which contains a sale hierarchy that should appear for a set timeframe may be scheduled to publish on a given date and time within a given timezone. For instance, a sale that should begin on 1st of June 2022 05:00 ET and end on the 15th of June 2022 at 23:50 PT would have a valid schedule of `"valid_from": "2022-06-01T05:00:00.000-05:00",` `"valid_to": "2022-06-15T11:59:99.000-08:00"`. |
