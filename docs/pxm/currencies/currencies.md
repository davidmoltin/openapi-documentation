:::caution
The Currency API is for Administrator use only. Do not use these endpoints on your customer-facing frontends.
:::

In your store, you can display prices to customers in their local currency. You can configure up to ten currencies per store.

Configure currencies only for the locales in which you do business, and select one of the currencies to be the default currency. If a default currency is not selected, the store uses the United States Dollar (USD).

After a customer selects a locale, the product prices in the catalog, carts, and orders are displayed in the currency for that locale. Order totals and taxes are calculated in the same currency. You cannot have a cart or order where product prices are in mixed currencies.
