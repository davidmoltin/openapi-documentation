Several Product Experience Manager endpoints function as jobs. When any of these endpoints are run, a job is automatically created.

- product [**import**](#tag/Product-ImportBulk-Update).
- product [**export**](#tag/Product-Export/operation/exportProducts).
- price book import
- [**duplicating hierarchies**](#tag/Hierarchies/operation/duplicateHierarchy).
- [**building child products**](#tag/Variations/operation/buildChildProducts).

#### Characteristics of Jobs

Jobs have the following characteristics.

- Jobs are asynchronous.
- Jobs have a different status, depending on where a job is in its lifecycle. See [**Job Lifecycle**](#job-lifecycle).
- Jobs include the data used when an endpoint is run.
- Jobs are processed one at a time. You can continue to send requests using endpoints that function as jobs, but those jobs are queued. In other words, Commerce looks for any jobs that have a status of PENDING and starts the job with the earliest created date. This process is repeated until all jobs are processed.
- Jobs report messages and/or errors to help you understand:

   - what changes a job implemented in Commerce.
   - the reasons for any failed jobs.

#### Job Lifecycle

A job has the following lifecycle.

![job lifecycle](/assets/job-lifecycle.png)

- **PENDING** - Commerce has received the request but is currently busy processing other requests.
- **STARTED** - Commerce has started processing the job.
- **SUCCESS** - The job has successfully completed.
- **FAILED** - The job has failed. See [**Get job errors**](#tag/Jobs/operation/getAllJobs).
