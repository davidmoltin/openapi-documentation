Use the catalog-view service API to create your catalogs.
              
You also have the flexibility to create catalogs for different scenarios by combining hierarchies of products with a price book. Scenarios might include:

- Multiple geographical regions. Display different catalogs in different regions with suitable pricing or combine product hierarchies from two different regions to display in a third region.
- Multiple channels. Display different catalogs based on how a shopper accesses your store, such as through a mobile app or a web storefront.
- Direct to business versus direct to customers. Offer different products and prices for business customers versus retail customers.
- Preferred customers. Offer special pricing to preferred customers while displaying a standard price catalog to all other shoppers.
- Reward programs. Enable reward programs where catalog prices drop after a certain spending level is reached.
- Product sales. Offer sale items for a limited time.
 
Scenarios are created by defining the context within which a catalog is displays. Contexts can be a customer ID, a channel, or any other user-defined tag that can be passed to the APIs from the front-end shopper experiences.
