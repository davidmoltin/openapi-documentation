A catalog contains the products available for sale either in your organization or store. A catalog also contains information about how to organize those products for navigation menus and search facets in a shopper experience.

Before you create a catalog you must define the following resources:

- Hierarchies: hierarchies and nodes to categorize the products. See [**Hierarchies**](#hierarchies).
- Products: product information, associated assets, and links to hierarchy nodes. See [**Product Types**](#product-types).
- Price Books: prices for the products associated with the hierarchies. See [**Price Books**](#price-books).

A catalog is a combination of hierarchies and a price book.

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
