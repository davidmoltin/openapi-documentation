Commerce automatically assigns types to the products you create. Product types can be used in catalogs. For example, in your catalog, you can filter on `parent` so that only your parent products are displayed in your storefront.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
