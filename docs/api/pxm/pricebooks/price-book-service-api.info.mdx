You can use the price books service to configure your product pricing. Your price books are associated with your catalogs. Creating separate price books enables you to:

- Maintain consistent and accurate pricing across all your product listings and channels.
- Provide competitive pricing by creating different price books for different channels. For example, different pricing for different geographical regions, based on standard of living costs.
- Provide personalized pricing by creating personalized price books. For example, pricing for loyalty customers versus new customers.
- Enable cross-selling and upselling by offering sales and volume pricing for your products.
- Create price-books based on real-time adjustments such as inventory levels and market conditions.
