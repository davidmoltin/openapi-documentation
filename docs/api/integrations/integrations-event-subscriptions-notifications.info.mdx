You can integrate Commerce with your external systems like enterprise resource planning, order management, fulfilment, and other systems, ensuring that buying is quick and easy for your shoppers.

Events are actions that occur in your commerce workflow, such as a customer changing their address or an order changing status from created to paid. You can create custom functions that perform additional processing outside of Commerce, and create integrations so that when an event occurs in your store, the custom function is run.

For example:

- When a customer updates their address, the Customer Relationship Management system is updated with the change.
- When an order status changes to paid, the affected stock in an inventory management system is reduced by the number of items in the order.

Events are processed concurrently. This means that events may not be delivered in the order they are created. For example, if the status of an order is updated multiple times, the events may not be delivered in the same sequence they were updated. Integration events operate on an "at least once" delivery policy. We aim to deliver messages within 30 minutes or less. Ensure that you design your receiving code accordingly.

>**Note**
>
>For a list of all the events that can be used, see [Observable Events](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/observable-events) in the API reference.

You can integrate Commerce with your external systems using:

- Webhooks
- Message Queuing Services

### Webhooks

You can use Webhooks to deliver Commerce events to a configured HTTP endpoint.

### Message Queuing Services

You can deliver Commerce events to messages queues through the following message queuing services:

- Amazon Simple Queuing Service (SQS)
- Message queuing services that support the Message Simple Text Orientated Messaging Protocol (STOMP), for example, Amazon MQ.

>**Important**
>
> You can integrate Amazon SQS and message queuing services that support STOMP through the Integrations API. You can view the integration details in Commerce Manager > **SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Webhooks**. For more information, see [Create an integration](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/integrations-api/create-an-integration)

### Integration Types

Commerce supports the following integration types:

- Using [webhooks](#webhooks), you can have Commerce deliver events to a configured HTTP endpoint.

>**Warning**
> 
>Webhooks that return anything other than a 2XX status code, or take more than 10 seconds to respond, are considered failed.

- Using [message queuing services](#message-queuing-services), you can deliver Commerce events to a message queue. The advantages of using message queuing services over webhooks are:

    - A temporary failure of a webhook endpoint can result in lost events. However, if messages are on your own queue, you can leave the event on the queue to retry later.
    - If events take a long time to process, a webhook can timeout, but delivery to a queue is always going to take the same amount of time.

### Webhooks

An integration with an `integration_type` of [`webhook`](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/integrations-api/create-an-integration#configuring-an-aws-sqs-queue) delivers its events to a configured HTTP endpoint.

### Message Queuing Services

Elastic Path allows you to integrate with the following message queuing services:

- Amazon Simple Message Queuing Service (SQS).
- Message queuing services that use Simple Text Orientated Messaging Protocol (STOMP), for example, Amazon MQ.

>**Important**

>You can integrate Amazon SQS and message queuing services that support STOMP through the Integrations API. You can view the integration details in Commerce Manager > **SYSTEM** > **Store Settings** > **Webhooks**. For more information, see [Create an integration](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/integrations-api/create-an-integration).

#### Amazon Simple Message Queuing Service (SQS)

An integration with an `integration_type` of [`aws_sqs`](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/integrations-api/create-an-integration#configuring-an-aws-sqs-queue) delivers its events directly into the configured AWS SQS queue. These messages can be processed by any appropriate means, such as a Lambda function.

For more information about creating Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, see the [Simple Queue Service (SQS)](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/sqs-queues) and [SQS Events with CloudFormation](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/sqs-queues-cloudformation) sections.

#### Simple Text Orientated Messaging Protocol (STOMP)

An integration with the [`stomp`](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/integrations-api/create-an-integration) integration type delivers its events directly into a configured queue. Any message queuing service that uses STOMP, such as Amazon MQ, can process these messages.

For more information, see the documentation provided with the message queuing service you are using.

### Observable Events

You can pass multiple observable keys to the `observes` field of the [integration object](/docs/commerce-cloud/integrations/integrations-api/overview#integration-object), or you can create individual events. You can use an array when you handle multiple webhooks at the same URL.
